## 題目

Show that a set $A$ is bounded iff there is a constant $M$, s.t. $d(x,y)\le M$, for all $x, y\in A$. Give a plausible definition of the diameter of a set and reformulate your result.

## 解答

May assume $A\neq\empty$, otherwise it is trivial.

### $\implies$ 

Since $A$ is bounded, for all $x\in A$, $d(0,x)\le C$ for some constant $C$. Choose $M = 2C$, then $d(x,y)\le d(0,x) + d(x,y)\le 2C = M.$ 

### $\impliedby$ 

Fixed $x_0\in A$, choose a constant $N=M+d(0,x_0)$. For all $y\in A$, we have $d(0,y)\le d(x_0,y)+d(0,x_0)\le N$, then $A$ is bounded.

The diameter of the set is the $\sup\lbrace\ d(x, y)\mid x, y\in A\ \rbrace$. A set $A$ is bounded iff the diameter of $A$ is finite.
