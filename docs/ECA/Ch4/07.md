## 題目

Consider a compact set $B\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $f:B\to\mathbb{R}^n$ be continuous and one-to-one. Then prove that $f^{-1}:f(B)\to B$ is continuous. Show by example that this may fail if $B$ is connected but not compact.

## 解答

Choose a closed set $C\subset B$, and we have $C$ is compact since $B$ is closed. Since $f$ is continuous, $f(C)$ is compact, and $f$ is one-to-one we have $f^{-1}(f(C)) = C$, so $f^{-1}$ is continuous.

Choose 


$$
\begin{aligned}
f&: [0,2\pi[\to\mathbb{R}^2\\ 
f(x)&= (\cos(x), \sin(x))\\
B&=\lbrace(\cos(x),\sin(x))\mid -\pi/3\leq x\leq\pi/3\rbrace
\end{aligned}
$$


Since $f^{-1}(B) = [0,\pi/3]\bigcup[5\pi/3,2\pi[$, then $f^{-1}$ isn't continuous.
