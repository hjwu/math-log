## 題目

A real-valued function defined on $]a,b[$ is called convex when the following inequality hold for $x,y$ in $]a,b[$ and $t$ in $[0,1]$: 

$$
f(tx+(1-t)y)\le tf(x) + (1-t)f(y).
$$

If $f$ has a continuous second derivative and $f^{\prime\prime} > 0$, show that $f$ is convex.

## 解答

By MVT, for $y < x$, there is a $c\in [y,x]$, s.t. $f(x)-f(y) = f^{\prime}(c)(x-y)$.

Since $f^{\prime\prime} > 0$, $f^{\prime}$ is strickly increasing.

Choose $z = tx+(1-t)y$. 

If $z\in [c,x]$, for some $k\ge c$, we have 


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x)-f(z)&= f^{\prime}(k)(x-z)\\
&\ge f^{\prime}(c)(x-z)\\
&= f^{\prime}(c)(1-t)(x-y)\\
&= (1-t)f^{\prime}(c)(x-y) = (1-t)(f(x)-f(y))\\
\end{aligned}
$$


We have $f(z)\le tf(x) + (1-t)f(y).$

Otherwise $z\in [y,c]$, by same way, we are done.
