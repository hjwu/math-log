## 題目

Let $f_1,\cdots, f_N$ be continuous from $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$. Let $m_i$ be the maximum of $f_i$ , that is $m_i = \sup f_i(A)$. Let $f = \sum f_i$ and $m = \sup f(A)$. Show that $m\leq\sum m_i$. Given an example where equality fails.

## 解答

For all $x\in A$, we have $f(x) = \sum f_i(x)\leq \sum m_i$, then $\sum m_i$ is also an upper bound of $f(A)$, so $m\leq\sum m_i$.

Choose $f_1(x) = x, f_2(x) = -x$, and $A=[0,1]$. Then $m = 0$ and $\sum m_i=1$.
