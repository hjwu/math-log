Consider a function $f:A\times B\to\mathbb{R}^m$, where $A\subset\mathbb{R}, B\subset\mathbb{R}^p$.

Call $f$ separately continuous iff for each fixed $x_0\in A$, the map $g(y) = f(x_0,y)$ is continuous and for $y_0 \in B$, $h(x) = f(x,y_0)$ is continuous. 

Say that $f$ is continuous on $A$ uniformly with respect to $B$ if for each $\epsilon > 0$ and $x_0 \in A$, there is a $\delta > 0$ s.t. $\|x-x_0\| < \delta$, implies $\|f(x,y)-f(x_0,y)\| < \epsilon$ for $y \in B$. 

Show that if $f$ is separately continuous and is continuous on $A$ uniformly with respect to $B$, then f is continuous.

## 解答

Given $(x_0,y_0)$ and arbitrary $\epsilon>0$.

Since $f$ is separately continuous, we have
+ there is a $\delta_1$ s.t. $\|y_0 - y\|< \delta_1$, implies $\|g(y_0)-g(y)\| < \epsilon/2$.
+ there is a $\delta_2$ s.t. $\|x_0 - x\|< \delta_2$, implies $\|h(x_0)-h(x)\| < \epsilon/2$.

Since $f$ is continuous on $A$ uniformly with respect to $B$, then here is a $\delta_3$ s.t. $\|x_0 - x\|< \delta_3$, implies $\|f(x_0,y)-f(x,y)\| < \epsilon/2$.

Hence we choose $\delta = \delta_1 + \min\\{\delta_2,\delta_3\\}$ s.t. 


$$
\|(x_0,y_0)-(x,y)\|\leq\|y_0 - y\|+\|x_0 - x\|< \delta_1 + \min\{\delta_2,\delta_3\} = \delta.
$$


implies 


$$
\begin{aligned}
\|f(x_0,y_0) - f(x,y)\|&\leq\|f(x_0,y_0) - f(x_0,y)\|+\|f(x_0,y)-f(x,y)\|\\
&=\|g(y_0)-g(y)\|+\|f(x_0,y)-f(x,y)\|\\
&< \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$
