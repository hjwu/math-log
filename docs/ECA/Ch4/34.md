## 題目

Assuming that the temperature on the surface of the earth is a continuous function, prove that on any great circle of the earth there are two antipodal points with the same temperature.

## 解答

Pick a great circle on the earth and a point $p$ on that circle. Let $T(\theta)$ be the temperature at rads, measured counter-clockwise from $p$. 

Consider the function $S(\theta) = T(\theta)- T(\theta+\pi)$. 

Then $S(0) = T(0)- T(\pi) = -S(\pi)$, by [Intermediate Value Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) we have $0 = T(x) - T(x+\pi)$ for some $x$.
