## 題目

Let $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be closed and $x_n\in A$ be a Cauchy sequence. Prove that $x_n$ converge to a point in $A$

## 解答

Since $A$ is closed, choose a subsequence of $x_n$ converge to a point in $A$.

And we know a subsequence of Cauchy sequence converge to a point $x$, then the Cauchy sequence $x_n$ converge to a point $x\in A$.
