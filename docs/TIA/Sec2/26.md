+ (a) Let $G$ be the group of all $2\times 2$ matrices $\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}$ where $a,b,c,d$ are intergers modulo $p$, $p$ a prime number, such that $ad-bc\neq0$. $G$ forms a group relative to matrix multiplication. What is $o(G)$ ?

+ (b) Let $H$ be the subgroup of $G$ of part(a) defined by
    $$
    H = \bigg\lbrace\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{bmatrix}\text{ in } G\mid ad-bc = 1\bigg\rbrace.
    $$
    What is $o(H)$?

### è§£ç­” (a)

Let ${[0],[1],\cdots, [p-1]}$ be the set of the congruence classes modulo $p$.

The number of occurrences of $ad$ in $[0]$ is $2p-1$, and in any other class, it is $p-1$.

It's easy to get the sum as $p(p+1)(p-1)^2$.

### è§£ç­” (b)

1. You can check case by case.
2. Or note that the numbers for which $ad-bc = k$ are the same for $k > 0$. Hence, $o(H) = o(G)/(p-1) = p(p+1)(p-1)$.

I prefer the second way as well. ðŸ˜‹
