## 題目

If $\bm{A}\in\mathcal{M}^3(F)$ is such that the vectors $w_1, \cdots, w_n$, where $w_s$ is column $s$ of $\bm{A}$, satisfy a relation of the form $a_{1}w_{1} + a_{2}w_{2} + \cdots + a_{n}w_{n} = \bm{0}$, where the $a_r\in F$ and not all of them are $0$, then show that $\bm{A}v=\bm{0}$ for some $v\neq \bm{0}$ in $F^n$ by describing in the coordinate of such a $v$.

## 提示

$\bm{A}\begin{bmatrix}a_1, \cdots, a_n\end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{0}$
