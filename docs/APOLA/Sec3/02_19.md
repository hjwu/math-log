## 題目

If $\bm{A}\in\mathcal{M}_3(F)$ is not invertible, show that you can find a $v\neq \mathbf{0}\in F^3$ such that $\bm{A}v = \bm{0}.$

## 解答

Suppose $\forall v\neq\bm{0}$ such that $\bm{A}v=u\neq\bm{0}$.

Since $\bm{A}: F^3\to F^3$, domain and range have the same dimension, then the linear transformation of $\bm{A}$ is 1-1 and onto.

So there is a linear transformation $\bm{B}$, s.t. $\bm{B}u = v$, hence $\bm{AB}u = \bm{A}(\bm{B}u) = \bm{A}v = u$, i.e. $\bm{AB}=\bm{I}$, we get a contradiction.
