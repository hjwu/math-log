## 題目

Using problem 8 and 9, show that two $n\times n$ matrices $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{B}$ are row equivalent if and only if $\bm{B} = \bm{UA}$ for some invertible $n\times n$ matrix $\bm{U}$

## 解答

### $\implies$

$\bm{A}$ and $\bm{B}$ are row equivalent, then by definition we have $\bm{B} = \bm{KA}$ for some $n\times n$ matrix $\bm{K}$.

Since the solution of $\bm{K}(\bm{A}x) = 0$ is $\bm{A}x = 0$, we have $\bm{K}$ is invertible.

### $\impliedby$

By [Sec 3.8 Q8](08_08), $\bm{U}$ is invertible then $\bm{U}$ is row equivalent to $\bm{I}$. Then by [Sec 3.8 Q9](08_09), $\bm{UA}=\bm{B}$ is row equivalent to $\bm{IA}=\bm{A}$
