## 題目

Generate Problem 18 as follows : given $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m$ in $\mathcal{F}^n$ which are linearly independent over $\mathcal{F}$, and $m < n$, show that you can find elements $w_{m+1}, \cdots, w_n$ form a basis of $\mathcal{F}^n$ over $\mathcal{F}$.

## 解答

Choose $w_{m+1}$ not in spanning set of $\lbrace\ v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m\ \rbrace$, it is easy to proof that $\lbrace\ v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m, w_{m+1}\ \rbrace$ are L.I.

By the same method, we can find $\lbrace\ v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_m, w_{m+1}, \cdots, w_n\ \rbrace$ are L.I. and $\dim(\mathcal{F}^n) = n$, so they are basis of $\mathcal{F}^n$.
